    "# Seminar Quantitative Mikrobiologie: Hands-on simulation genome scale metabolic models\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The seminar provides a guide of how to work with genome scale metabolic models (GSMM) of micro-organisms. The example organism we use is *E. coli*, for which reliable models are available in online databases. The goal is to get insight into flux distributions and general metabolic state as well as to find flux solutions that represent the highest possible over-produce of a metabolite, in our example succinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seminar uses Jupyter notebooks, a new way to use and visualize code in the web. Such a notebook is composed of a sequence of cells. Cellls can be either text/comments, like this introduction, or it contains python code to be run. In this example the code is evaluated by the cloud service [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). The output for each code-cell is shown directly below it. For a overview on Jupyter notebooks read [this review](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1). Another usefull resource to develop Jupyter notebooks is via [Google Colaboration](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of the seminar is adapted from a tutorial by the project Data-Driven Design of Cell Factories and Communities (DD-DeCaF) as well as workshop information available [here](https://biosustain.github.io/cell-factory-design-course/). More information on DD-DeDaF and the original files are [here](https://github.com/DD-DeCaF/tutorials). The simulations are performed using cobrapy (see [Ebrahim et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74)), the most widely used analysis tool for genome scale metabolic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The steps of this tutorial are:**\n",
    " * [Set-up compute environment](#Python-setup)\n",
    "   * loading programs for analysis (data analysis, plotting, cobrapy, escher)\n",
    "   * downloading *E. coli* GSMM (iJO1366)\n",
    " * [Model Analysis](#Model-Analysis)\n",
    "   * loading the model into cobrapy\n",
    "   * examining model structure and details (metabolites, reactions, medium)\n",
    "   * solving reaction flux distribution for optimal growth\n",
    "   * investigating reaction statistics within the solution (NADH and ATP turnover)\n",
    "   * visualizing flux activities in metabolic network\n",
    " * [Model Manipulation](#Model-Manipulation)\n",
    "   * setting new objective function\n",
    "   * visualizing optimal succinate flux distribution\n",
    "   * generating production envelope for the effect of growth rate on succinate production rate\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills you learn:**\n",
    "* Familiarizing with Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* Retrieving genome scale model files\n",
    "* Manipulating and Simulating GSMM with cobrapy   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical comments:**\n",
    "* In some code cells you are supposed to enter input. The location at which input is required is marked by ''**?...?**''.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comments to explain details in the code bock are written with a hash **plus blank**. \n",
    "Alternative commands and commands providing somewhat more detailed information are deactivated with a hash **without blank**."

This can be achieved using the production envelope if you plot growth as dependent variable against oxygen exchange (uptake rate/ transport). \n",
