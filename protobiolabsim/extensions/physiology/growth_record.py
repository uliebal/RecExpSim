"""
The Growth record stores a possible growth outcome.

TODO: Currently not using as GrowthBehaviour.grow is outputtin a DataFrame.
  Think about it, but I believe using Records (and maybe Registries) could be better.
  For example, a GrowthRegistry could be a specialized table that can be queried for
  aggregated results or plots.
