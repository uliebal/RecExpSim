    # REFACTOR: Some separate but related points:
    #   - An important concept on Object-Oriented Programming (using classes) is that
    #     each class should have a 'single responsibility'.
    #     For example, a Host should only be do things that are normal for hosts: hold information
    #     about its existence, clone itself, eat, etc. This premise of single-responsibility
    #     prevents the Host from having properties such as `var_Library` because it means that
    #     Hosts normally keep track of their lineage. Even knowing what an Experiment ID is might
    #     already be too much responsibility for a Host.
    #   - Whenever possible, prefer returning values than outputting them. Ideally, the entire
    #     `biolabsim` module should have no prints as side-effects from calculations. That way,
    #     it is the end-user's decision if they want to use the values for further calculations
    #     or if they want to print them on the screen/graph/file. This also applies for plotting.
    #     End-user in this case is whoever is using `biolabsim`: either someone importing the
    #     module or the code inside the notebook.
    #   - Methods like `Test(self)` mention a very specific type of Host. Given the specificity,
    #     this method should better be external to this class definition.
    #   - Having some accessor methods to the strain are possible to make the Host API easier to use.
    #     Like `host.get_genome()` just returning `host.strain.genome`.
