    "## Introduction\n",
    "The seminar provides a guide of how to work with genome scale metabolic models (GSMM) of micro-organisms. This seminar extends the introduction to CobraPy from the seminar in Quantitative Microbiology 1. The goal of this seminar is to identify minimal medium composition, extract information about and selecting the appropriate biomass composition formula and testing the reproduction of experimental data by the GSMM. We examine a recent model of *P. pastoris* ([Tomas-Gamisans et al., 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.12871)). This organism is of biotechnological relevance because it can glycosylate recombinant proteins for use as drugs and it can metabolize methanol as a potential alternative to petrol based chemistry ([Liebal et al., 2018](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mec.2018.e00075)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyse the GSMM of *P. pastoris* to estimate for the exchange reactions the range of permissible flux values. This indicates which phenotypes we can expect during standard cultivation and can highlight easily overproduced metabolites. Subsequently, we will identify the minimal medium composition. An important property of GSMM is their ability to predict growth rates. We will extract experimentally measured growth rates for various substrates and compare them with predictions of the model. The data reproduction is exemplified with the substrates of methanol and glycerol and the self-learning task is to supplement growth rates based on glucose uptake rate from literature ([Lehnen et al., 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meteno.2017.07.001)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The seminar uses Jupyter notebooks, a new way to use and visualize code in the web. Such a notebook is composed of a sequence of cells. Cellls can be either text/comments, like this introduction, or it contains python code to be run. In this example the code is evaluated by the cloud service [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). The output for each code-cell is shown directly below it. For a overview on Jupyter notebooks read [this review](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1). Another usefull resource to develop Jupyter notebooks is via [Google Colaboration](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",

    "\n",
    "*E. coli* is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe and nonsporulating bacterium of the genus *Escherichia*. It is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. *E. coli* can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. The bacterium is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, it takes as little as 20 minutes to reproduce. You can find more information here: [*Escherichia coli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli)      \n",
    "\n",
    "*Pseudomonas putida* is a Gram-negative road-shaped, saprotrophic soil bacterium occurring in various environmental niches, due to its metabolic versatility and low nutritional requirements. Initiated by the pioneering discovery of its high capability to degrade rather recalcitrant and inhibiting xenobiotics, extensive biochemical analysis of this bacterium has been carried out in recent years. In addition, *P. putida* shows a very high robustness against extreme environmental conditions such as high temperature, extreme pH, or the presence of toxins or inhibiting solvents. Additionally, it is genetically accessible and grows fast with simple nutrient demand. Meanwhile, *P. putida* is successfully used for the production of bio-based polymers and a broad range of chemicals, far beyond its initial purpose for the degradation of various toxic compounds. You can find more information here: [DOI: 10.1007/s00253-012-3928-0](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221847539_Industrial_biotechnology_of_Pseudomonas_putida_and_related_species)\n",
