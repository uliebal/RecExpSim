    "# Simulation of Recombinant Protein Expression\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, selected key steps of a biotechnological project for recombinant protein expressions are simulated. In biotechnology, the work is increasingly digitized with automated experiments. The main contributions of scientists shift from performing experiments in the wet lab to planning the experiments and analysing the data computationaly. This simulation provides an introduction into data streams in biotechnology. The goal is to optimize the expression rate of a protein above a minimum rate to make it economically competitive. To achieve this goal, virtual experiments have to be performed to optimize growth conditions and promoter sequence for the production. Finally, a comparison will be performed how the GC-content of the promoter affects the promoter activity. For assessment, please upload the GC-content versus promoter activity plot to Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation is based on a Jupyter Python Notebook. All the time you should work in this notebook named *1-Laboratory.ipynb*. You just have to work through it from top to bottom. There is no need to open another notebook or programming script. Later during the workflow of the laboratory tasks, you need to download an Excel file, which will be automatically created in the folder and will appear in the navigation panel on the left side. Moreover at the end of this notebook the created plot must be downloaded in the same way to upload it to Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are becoming popular to distribute data science solutions and to make coding flexible and user friendly. The Notebooks are composed of a sequence of cells that can be either text, like this introduction, or python code cells to be run. Code cells have a grey background, and after execution the output is shown directly beneath. A blue stripe on the left edge of the screen marks the currently active cell. More information on how to use Jupyter Notebooks are [here](https://medium.com/edureka/jupyter-notebook-cheat-sheet-88f60d1aca7). In general, two input modes exist: \n",
    "* Command mode: evaluation of code, `Escape` or click outside cell activates Command mode\n",
    "* Edit mode: writing into cells, `Enter` or double-click inside cell activates Edit mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating in Jupyter:\n",
    "*  activate cell above/below: `arrow up/down keys` in Command mode.     \n",
    "*  execute cell: `Ctrl + Enter` in Command mode.\n",
    "*  hide/show navigation panel on the left: click on folder symbol or `Ctrl + b`\n",
    "*  here **`None`** designates places for user input\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell can also be edited and executed multiple times. Next to the code cells in the upper left corner the status of the cell is displayed in square brackets. If you have not executed a cell yet, the brackets are empty. If the computer is currently executing the code, an small star appears there. If the cell has been executed, a number corresponding to the execution order of the cells is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information is important if you get stuck in the workflow or if you have changed the code to become dysfunctional. If the resources run out or you are unsatisfied with your choices, restart the kernel: click on Kernel in the top bar and select restart. All information on your strain and all you executions are resetted and you get a slightly different system, whose properties you have to find out again. If you have inserted your own code to the extend that the simulation is dysfunctional, or you have deleted original code accidentally and you wish to come back to the original state you have to delete the biolabsim folder. To do so, use the last cell in this notebook. You will have to shut down and reload the Jupyter Notebook instance as described in the last cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional workbook named *2-Assistance.ipynb* contains guidance for some of the experiments. You can open it by double-click on the name in the left navigation panel. Then the notebook will open in a new window like you know it from a browser. To switch back to the original notebook, just select the other tab again or close the new one with the 'x'.     \n",
    "The workflow starts by preparing the computational system followed by strain characterization cultivations, experiments for promoter sequence selection and finally the experiment to measure the achieved expression rate.\n",

The bacterium is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, it takes as little as 20 minutes to reproduce. You can find more information here: [*Escherichia coli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli)      \n",
    "\n",
    "*Pseudomonas putida* is a Gram-negative road-shaped, saprotrophic soil bacterium occurring in various environmental niches, due to its metabolic versatility and low nutritional requirements. Initiated by the pioneering discovery of its high capability to degrade rather recalcitrant and inhibiting xenobiotics, extensive biochemical analysis of this bacterium has been carried out in recent years. In addition, *P. putida* shows a very high robustness against extreme environmental conditions such as high temperature, extreme pH, or the presence of toxins or inhibiting solvents. Additionally, it is genetically accessible and grows fast with simple nutrient demand. Meanwhile, *P. putida* is successfully used for the production of bio-based polymers and a broad range of chemicals, far beyond its initial purpose for the degradation of various toxic compounds.

    "### 2.2 Promoter sequence selection\n",
    "In bacteria, the initiation of transcription at promoters requires a dissociable specificity subunit of RNA polymerase called sigma that binds to the core to form the \"holoenzyme\". Sigma factors play critical roles in transcription initiation, including the recognition and opening of promoters as well as the initial steps in RNA synthesis. The number of sigma factors varies between bacterial species. Sigma factors are distinguished by their characteristic molecular weights. The primary sigma factor or the \"housekeeping\" sigma factor sigma70 of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria has a molecular weight of 70 kDa. Every cell has such a \"housekeeping\" sigma factor that directs the bulk of transcription during active growth. The following article introduces the sigma70 transcription factor and reports the optimal recognition sequence that is responsible for gene expression in this project [https://doi.org/10.3390/biom5031245](https://doi.org/10.3390/biom5031245).     \n",

To test the sequences, you have to clone each of them, introduce the resulting construct into the organism and then perform an expression test by measuring the promoter strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Cloning\n",
    "In order to perform a successful cloning, you have to design a suitable primer for each promoter. In addition, a melting temperature matching the primer sequence must be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "First create the primers matching your promoter sequences and the following characteristics and write them down in your Excel file. The primers should always start at the first nucleotide of the promoter sequences and are composed of complementary bases. You have to identify the optimal primer length of your strain. Like the optimal growth temperature this parameter was also randomly initiated based on a certain interval containing all values that the parameter can take so that cloning still works. Possible values for the optimal primer length are between 15 - 30 nucleotides and successfull primers need to be within 20% length distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then calculate the melting temperature for each primer and write it into your Excel sheet. On the following website you will find formulas for calculating the melting temperature. A sodium concentration of 100 mM is assumed. The deviation from the optimal melting temperature should be within 10%. Formulas for calculating the melting temperature: [genelink manual](https://www.genelink.com/Literature/ps/R26-6400-MW.pdf)     \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally perform a cloning with each pair of promoter and primer followed directly by the measurement of the promoter strength to test the expression. Each cloning experiment gets a specific Clone_ID like for exmaple : \"Clone_1\". This automatically designates the corresponding generated clone that contains the corresponding promoter sequence. To perform a cloning experiment, all you have to do is to execute the `Make_Cloning(Clone_ID, Promoter, Primer, Tm)`-command. For the parameters in this commmand you can enter either the appropriate variable or the respective name/value/sequence.    \n",
    "**Important note/warning:** For successful cloning, the primer length is not allowed to deviate too much from the optimal one specific for the strain, as described above. Furthermore, cloning will not work if the melting temperature deviates too much from the optimal one. This means it is quite common that the entire cloning step is a tricky and time consuming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cloning fails, because one of the mentioned necessary conditions was not fulfilled, the sequence could not be multiplied and introduced into the organism. Then the melting temperature, the total primer length or the complementarity of bases may need to be adjusted.
