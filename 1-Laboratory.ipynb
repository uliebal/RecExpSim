    "# Corona Vaccine Recombinant Expression Simulation\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Corona has the world in its grip and the production of vaccines lags demand. A number of successfull vaccination strategies is based on recombinantly produced viral RNA fragments. It happens that you are member of a small biotech company, specialized in recombinant expression systems. Your goal is to use your expression system and optimize the expression of viral RNA in a large number of bacterial cells. The expression is controlled by important sequences in the promoter and the final RNA vaccine titer/concentration depends on cell biomass, how well did the cells growth in the culture conditions. But have an eye on your resources. Each experiment is costly and you can perform only a limited number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, selected key steps of a biotechnological project for recombinant expressions are simulated. The experimental work in your biotech company is highly automated: you are setting the parameters of the experiments and focus on computational data analysis. The goal is to optimize the expression rate of the RNA vaccine to be competitive and outcompeting the production rates of your competitors. To achieve this goal, virtual experiments have to be performed to optimize growth conditions and promoter sequence for the production. Finally, a comparison will be performed how the GC-content of the promoter affects the promoter activity. The data analysis can be performed either separately with Excel, or with some guided coding steps within this script. \n",
    "\n",
    "The investments for the biotechnological experiments are listed below. To optimize your initial host-promoter combination towards more effective production, a number of 4-6 strains might be necessary, calculate how much experiments can be performed. Some steps are difficult to perform. The exact parameters for effective cloning are unknown and depend on various complex factors.\n",

    "This simulation is based on a Jupyter Python Notebook. All the time you should work in this notebook named *1-Laboratory.ipynb*. You just have to work through it from top to bottom. Notebooks are becoming popular to distribute data science solutions and to make coding flexible and user friendly. The Notebooks are composed of a sequence of cells that can be either text, like this introduction, or python code cells to be run. Code cells have a grey background, and after execution the output is shown directly beneath. A blue stripe on the left edge of the screen marks the currently active cell. More information on how to use Jupyter Notebooks are [here](https://medium.com/edureka/jupyter-notebook-cheat-sheet-88f60d1aca7). In general, two input modes exist: \n",
    "* Command mode: evaluation of code, `Escape` or click outside cell activates Command mode\n",
    "* Edit mode: writing into cells, `Enter` or double-click inside cell activates Edit mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating in Jupyter:\n",
    "*  activate cell above/below: `arrow up/down keys` in Command mode.     \n",
    "*  execute cell: `Ctrl + Enter` in Command mode.\n",
    "*  hide/show navigation panel on the left: click on folder symbol or `Ctrl + b`\n",
    "*  here **`None`** designates places for user input\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell can also be edited and executed multiple times. Next to the code cells in the upper left corner the status of the cell is displayed in square brackets. If you have not executed a cell yet, the brackets are empty. If the computer is currently executing the code, an small star appears there. If the cell has been executed, a number corresponding to the execution order of the cells is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information is important if you get stuck in the workflow or if you have changed the code to become dysfunctional. If the resources run out or you are unsatisfied with your choices, restart the kernel: click on Kernel in the top bar and select restart. All information on your strain and all you executions are resetted and you get a slightly different system, whose properties you have to find out again. If you have inserted your own code to the extend that the simulation is dysfunctional, or you have deleted original code accidentally and you wish to come back to the original state you have to delete the biolabsim folder. To do so, use the last cell in this notebook. You will have to shut down and reload the Jupyter Notebook instance as described in the last cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional workbook named *2-Assistance.ipynb* contains guidance for some of the experiments. You can open it by double-click on the name in the left navigation panel. Then the notebook will open in a new window like you know it from a browser. To switch back to the original notebook, just select the other tab again or close the new one with the 'x'.     \n",
    "The workflow starts by preparing the computational system followed by strain characterization cultivations, experiments for promoter sequence selection and finally the experiment to measure the achieved expression rate.\n",

It is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. *E. coli* can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. The bacterium is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, it takes as little as 20 minutes to reproduce. You can find more information here: [*Escherichia coli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli)      \n",

    "*Pseudomonas putida* is a Gram-negative road-shaped, saprotrophic soil bacterium occurring in various environmental niches, due to its metabolic versatility and low nutritional requirements. Initiated by the pioneering discovery of its high capability to degrade rather recalcitrant and inhibiting xenobiotics, extensive biochemical analysis of this bacterium has been carried out in recent years. In addition, *P. putida* shows a very high robustness against extreme environmental conditions such as high temperature, extreme pH, or the presence of toxins or inhibiting solvents. Additionally, it is genetically accessible and grows fast with simple nutrient demand. Meanwhile, *P. putida* is successfully used for the production of bio-based polymers and a broad range of chemicals, far beyond its initial purpose for the degradation of various toxic compounds.

    "In bacteria, the initiation of transcription at promoters requires a dissociable specificity subunit of RNA polymerase called sigma that binds to the core to form the \"holoenzyme\". Sigma factors play critical roles in transcription initiation, including the recognition and opening of promoters as well as the initial steps in RNA synthesis. The number of sigma factors varies between bacterial species. Sigma factors are distinguished by their characteristic molecular weights. The primary sigma factor or the \"housekeeping\" sigma factor sigma70 of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria has a molecular weight of 70 kDa. Every cell has such a \"housekeeping\" sigma factor that directs the bulk of transcription during active growth. The following article introduces the sigma70 transcription factor and reports the optimal recognition sequence that is responsible for gene expression in this project [https://doi.org/10.3390/biom5031245](https://doi.org/10.3390/biom5031245).     \n",

    "The promoter strength represents expression per cell. Later, it is multiplied by the growth rate and the biomass concentration in order to determine the expression rate. The expression rate of the product should be maximized. For further information and an illustration of the context, you can look at the last section of the second *2-Assistance.ipynb*-notebook. After successful cloning determine the promoter strength in a subsequent experiment by entering the ID of your clone into the `Make_MeasurePromoterStrength(Clone_ID)`-command like it is shown in the cell below. Document the promoter strengths together with the automatically determined GC contents in your Excel table. You will need both later when you evaluate the results. If an incorrect sequence is used, for example containing typing errors, an error may occur when measuring the promoter strength and also when measuring the expression rate. The error message is: \"Key Error 'X'\".\n",
